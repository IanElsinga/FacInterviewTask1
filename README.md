# FacInterviewTask1 - ISO8583
FAC developer candidate coding evaluation task (ISO8583)

The task is to convert an object containing financial transaction fields 
into an ISO-8583 byte array. The TransactionMessage object and other 
supporting classes are based on live code you would be working with at FAC. 

Please refer to InterviewTask_ISO8583.vb in this Visual Studio 2015 project 
as the starting point and for further details.

The goal is for the conversion function to convert the sample Transaction 
to ISO-8583. A full implementation is potentially complex so provide as much 
functionality as you can in the timeframe given. 

The solution you provide will be tested by FAC with other sample 
transactions with the same fields.

Fundamental ISO-8583 specifications can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583. 

The solution implementation must be written in VB.Net. 

Please make any assumptions needed.

Please contact FAC if you encounter an issue with the specifications 
which would preclude a solution.
